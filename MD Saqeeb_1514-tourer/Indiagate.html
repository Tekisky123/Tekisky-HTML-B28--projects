        <h2>India Gate</h2>
        <p>
            India Gate is an iconic monument located in New Delhi, India. It is a war memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, built in the memory of Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Indian Army in World War I and the Afghan Wars. The monument stands at a height of 42 meters and is situated on the eastern end of Rajpath, formerly known as Kingsway. 

            India Gate is surrounded by lush green lawns and is often visited by tourists and locals alike. It serves as a popular gathering spot, especially during evenings and weekends. The Amar Jawan Jyoti, an eternal flame, burns at the base of the monument, commemorating the Indian soldiers who sacrificed their lives in various wars since independence.
            
            The architecture of India Gate is inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and is one of the most recognizable symbols of Delhi and India as a whole. It holds significant historical and cultural importance and is a poignant reminder of India's rich and complex colonial history.
