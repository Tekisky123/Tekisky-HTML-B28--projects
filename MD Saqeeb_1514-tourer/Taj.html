        <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal is an iconic symbol of India and one of the most famous
          buildings in the world. Here's some detailed information about it: <br> 1.
          Location: It is located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, on the
          banks of the Yamuna River. <br> 2. Construction: The Taj Mahal was
          built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife,
          Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631. Construction began
          in 1632 and was completed in 1653.  <br>3. Architecture: It is renowned
          for its stunning Mughal architecture, which combines elements from
          Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architectural styles.
          The white marble structure is adorned with intricate carvings and
          inlaid precious stones. <br> 4. Symbolism: The Taj Mahal is considered
          a symbol of eternal love and is often regarded as one of the most
          beautiful buildings in the world. Its construction involved artisans
          and craftsmen from all over the empire and beyond. <br> 5. Design: The
          main building is a mausoleum with a large dome and four minarets at
          each corner. The tomb of Mumtaz Mahal is placed at the center of an
          ornamental garden, with the tomb of Shah Jahan later added beside it. <br>
          6. Material: The main building material is white marble, which was
          transported from Rajasthan and other parts of India, and semi-precious
          stones like lapis lazuli, jade, crystal, turquoise, and sapphire were
          used for intricate decorations. <br> 7. World Heritage Site: In 1983,
          the Taj Mahal was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its
          cultural and historical significance. <br> 8. Visitor Information: It
          attracts millions of visitors annually from around the globe, making
          it one of the most visited landmarks in the world. The site is managed
          by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and has strict
          conservation measures in place to preserve its beauty and integrity.
          The Taj Mahal remains an enduring masterpiece of architecture and a
          testament to the power of love and beauty in human history.
